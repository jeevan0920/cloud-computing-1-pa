## Gossip Membership Protocol Algorithm

1. **Initialization:**
    - Each node maintains a list of members called the membership list.
    - Initially, each node knows only about itself.
    - Each node periodically selects a random member from its membership list to gossip with.

2. **Gossip:**
    - When a node gossips with another node:
        - It sends its membership list to the other node.
        - The receiving node merges the received membership list with its own.
        - It updates its own membership list based on the received list.
        - It selects a random subset of members from its updated membership list and gossips with them.

3. **Membership List Management:**
    - Nodes may detect failures through heartbeat mechanisms or timeout mechanisms.
    - If a node fails to receive a heartbeat from a member within a certain timeout period:
        - It marks that member as suspected.
        - If other nodes confirm the suspicion, the suspected member is removed from the membership list.
        - The node then selects a new member to gossip with to spread the updated membership list.

4. **Joining the Group:**
    - When a new node joins the group:
        - It contacts any existing member in the group and retrieves a membership list.
        - It updates its own membership list with the received list.
        - It starts participating in the gossip process by selecting a random member to gossip with.

5. **Leaving the Group:**
    - When a node leaves the group:
        - It removes itself from the membership list of other nodes.
        - It stops participating in the gossip process.

6. **Periodic Gossip:**
    - Nodes periodically select random members from their membership list to gossip with, ensuring that membership information is continuously disseminated throughout the network.
